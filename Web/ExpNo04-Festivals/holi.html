        <p> Holi is a Hindu festival that has been celebrated since ancient times. The Holi Festival is celebrated as a
            way to welcome in spring, and also is seen as a new beginning where people can release all their inhibitions
            and start fresh. It is said that during the Holi Festival, the gods turn a blind eye, and it’s one of the
            few times extremely devout Hindus allow themselves to let loose. They open up and enjoy each other’s
            company, take time to dance and party, and throw their cultural norms to the side. On the first day of the
            festival, a bonfire is lit to symbolically burn away all the bad and give way to a colorful and vibrant new
            future.

            At the Holi Festival, participants throw powder dye into the air, covering all in attendance with vibrant
            colors. In a religious sense, the colors are rich with symbolism and have multiple meanings: they can mean a
            vibrant new life and even represent sin in a way. For some, washing off the dye at the end of the day can
            mean new commitment to live well, as cleansing oneself of evils and demons.
