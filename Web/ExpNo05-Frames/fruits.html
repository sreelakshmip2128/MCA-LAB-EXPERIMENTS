    <p>Fruits are an important part of a healthy eating pattern and the source of many vital nutrients, including
        potassium, folate (folic acid), and antioxidants including polyphenols. Fruit such as blueberries, cranberries,
        strawberries and citrus also contain phytochemicals that are being studied for their added health benefits. </p>
