    <p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves.
        In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth,
        plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms,
        tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees.

        Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have
        independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The
        majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees
        tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million
        years. It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees in the world.</p>
