    <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is
        still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the
        flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat
        arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are
        fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers
        such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses. </p>
